## Role of self-motivation for academic success

Academic accomplishment involves a strong grip on the subject, along with nurturing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. While we cannot deny the importance of good quality education and a supportive system for the best delivery of education, self-motivation is the fundamental force that converts all these efforts into success. The next paragraph explains the significance of self-motivation for academic success, drawing upon personal experiences and evidence from the broader context of higher education.

Every student can recall numerous instances from their academic journey when self-motivation was a key to their success. There were numerous occasions in my tour of study when self-motivation played its role in guiding me toward my goals. One recent example is when I took a computer programming course in my BS program. It was the first time I was studying programming and facing many difficulties, but instead of losing heart, I kept reminding myself why I was doing this. This "why" fueled my self-motivation and made me determined to excel in the course. Alongside this, I revised my mathematical concepts, asked all types of questions to my teacher without hesitation, and dedicated extra time to learning the basics. This not only helped me to achieve a good score in the subject but also improved my fundamental mathematics skills, and enabling me to build a strong bond with my teachers. Duckworth et al. (2007) found that self-motivated individuals demonstrate higher levels of grit, which is the combination of passion and perseverance, leading to greater academic achievement. 

Intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation are the two main categories of self-motivation. An individual's own thoughts and self-driven desire to learn, achieve, and grow are called intrinsic motivation. Meanwhile, receiving praise or rewards for achievements from others falls into the category of extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is more important than extrinsic motivation for long-term academic success, as indicated by research conducted by Deci and Ryan (1985). According to their research, when students are intrinsically motivated, they will be more determined and resilient, avoiding the loss of hope. This behavior will ultimately lead to boosting their confidence and improving academic performance. Setting SMART goals is a crucial aspect of self-motivation. Specific and achievable goals are important to enhance motivation and performance, as indicated by Locke and Latham's research (2002). Measuring success makes the student focus on the areas where improvement is needed, which leads to accomplishment and desired rewards. Similarly, a self-motivated individual focuses on constructive feedback to enhance their accountability. This measurement of success and accountability helps them realize their position on the journey of success and how much further effort is needed on their part.

Like any other fruitful journey, the path to academic success is also full of challenges, such as difficult coursework, time constraints, or personal obstacles. A self-motivated student is equipped with resilience and perseverance to tackle these problems. For example, during my final year project of the BS program, I was required to conduct research regarding the practical application of my idea in the industry. Despite being an introvert and a foreigner in the city, I collaborated with my teammates and worked closely with my professor to seek guidance on exploring the industry and meeting with people to assess how my idea fit in the industry. I was able to achieve this due to self-motivation and a passion to complete the project. Duckworth et al. (2007) found that self-motivated individuals demonstrate higher levels of grit, which is the combination of passion and perseverance, leading to greater academic achievement. Self-motivated individuals exhibit a sense of autonomy and take ownership of their academic journey. They are proactive in seeking resources, asking questions, and actively participating in class discussions. This proactive approach fosters a sense of empowerment, which can positively impact academic outcomes.

Self-motivation is undoubtedly a significant factor in the pursuit of academic goals. It serves as the driving force that compels students to tackle challenges, discover the sources of intrinsic motivation, and develop a self-efficacy mechanism. Drawing upon incidents from personal experience and other research, it is evident that a self-motivated student is more resilient and determined to achieve their goals. Guiding and fostering self-motivation in students can significantly boost their performance and guarantee a successful outcome.
