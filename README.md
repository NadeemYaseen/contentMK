### 17th April Task:

Explain what we need for freelancing and what it is in your words?

Freelancing is a way of earning money by investing one's time and skills in completing tasks for firms, companies, or individuals. These tasks are typically defined in a contract between the freelancer and the hiring party. Unlike traditional office jobs, freelancing allows individuals to take on multiple projects or contracts with different clients simultaneously.
  
The first and most important thing to start freelancing is commitment. Once you're committed to freelancing, focus on learning skills you're passionate about and find enjoyable.  After developing your skills, create a portfolio to showcase your work, and then begin searching for clients. Craft compelling pitches to attract clients. Approach every task with passion, and deliver high-quality work that exceeds expectations. Never stop learning and growing as a freelancer
